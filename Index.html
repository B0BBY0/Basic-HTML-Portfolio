<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Rob, and I’m based in the UK. I’m currently studying data analytics and exploring how to communicate insights through visualizations and interactive dashboards. I have a growing interest in web technologies and enjoy using tools like GitHub Pages to share my work online.</p>

<p>My recent projects include creating visual dashboards and learning how to make data-driven websites more accessible to all users. My goal is to develop strong skills in analytics, web development, and storytelling with data.</p>
