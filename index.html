<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Robert, and I’m based in the UK. I have a background in education as a teacher of Mathematics as well as having spent 12 years in the City of London as an Investment Consultant. I’m currently studying data analytics and exploring how to communicate insights through visualizations and interactive dashboards. I have a growing interest in web technologies and enjoy using tools like GitHub Pages to share my work online.</p>

<p>My recent projects include creating visual dashboards and learning how to make data-driven websites more accessible to all users. My goal is to develop strong skills in analytics, web development, and storytelling with data.</p>
